"daqinterfacestate.hpp" initializes state diagram function names
"daqinterfacestate.cpp" creates the state diagram functions as member functions of daqInterfaceState object class, also created here

"mainwindow.cpp" is the mother file
    the string "CONFIGURATE" is in mainwindow.ui and there are several functions with the name in mainwindow.cpp, initialized in mainwindow.hpp
    connect() uses a socket to connect to a remote server?
        connect(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len)
    void MainWindow::status(const QString& status) sets a case for each state: the state diagram, what functions are enabled

    where is the included file "ui_mainwindow.h" ??
